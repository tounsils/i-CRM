## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1500 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

git add .
git commit -m "Commit tn76.com"
git push -u origin main

# USeful vscode plugins 
Wijmo Designer Extension

# install dependancies
php artisan compose install

# Regenerate vendor folder

Initially, we try to update the Composer. Before updating, we check the location of the root user. Because the Composer must run inside the Laravel project folder.

Once we are in this directory, we run the command,

    composer update

In most cases, updating the Composer will regenerate the vendor folder and the autoload.php file.

Alternatively, we can regenerate the autoload.php file using the command,

    composer dump-autoload

Later on, we check if the Laravel project works.

# Update Laravel
Modify laravel version inside composer.json then run: composer update

# Run laravel project locally
## Windows users:
- Download wamp: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
- Download and extract cmder mini: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/releases/download/v1.1.4.1/cmder_mini.zip
- Update windows environment variable path to point to your php install folder (inside wamp installation dir) (here is how you can do this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17727436/how-to-properly-set-php-environment-variable-to-run-commands-in-git-bash)
 

cmder will be refered as console

## Mac Os, Ubuntu and windows users continue here:
- Create a database locally named `homestead` utf8_general_ci 
- Download composer https://getcomposer.org/download/
- Pull Laravel/php project from git provider.
- Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`inside your project root and fill the database information.
  (windows wont let you do it, so you have to open your console cd your project root directory and run `mv .env.example .env` )
- Open the console and cd your project root directory
- Run `composer install` or ```php composer.phar install```
- Run `php artisan key:generate` 
- Run `php artisan migrate`
- Run `php artisan db:seed` to run seeders, if any.
- Run `php artisan serve`

You can now access your project at localhost:8000 :)


## If for some reason your project stop working do these:
- `composer install`
- `php artisan migrate`

# APP_ENV Application environment
production and local are just environment names that you can use to turn certain testing features on or off in different places.

In development (coding) environment use this settings:

APP_ENV=local  
APP_DEBUG=true

In the production (server) use this settings:

APP_ENV=production 
APP_DEBUG=false
